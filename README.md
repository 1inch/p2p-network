# The 1inch P2P Decentralized Network White Paper

## Abstract

In the emergent era of decentralized technologies, the centralization of web3 applications and backend services presents a paradox that undermines the foundational principles of the blockchain ethos. The 1inch Network is envisaged as a solution to this problem—a peer-to-peer, decentralized network infrastructure that acts as a substrate for the development of diverse web3 products. At its core, the network addresses the quintessential vulnerabilities associated with centralized web services, such as susceptibility to censorship and single points of failure, by providing a robust framework that is resistant to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks through an innovative payment channel system.

Each participant in the network, whether they are a user, a relayer, or a resolver, plays a critical role in sustaining the ecosystem. Users, interacting through lightweight web3 applications, initiate requests within the network. Relayers, operating in a capacity similar to traditional proxies, facilitate the transmission of these requests. Resolvers, the backbone of the network, perform the computations and return the requested data, thereby completing the cycle of interaction. These resolvers are selected based on the 1inch community's trust, conferred through a staking mechanism of the native 1INCH token that engenders a democratized validator-like model.

The amalgamation of these roles is harmonized through a payment system wherein transactions are signed and encapsulated within requests, safeguarding against unwanted network spam and incentivizing honest, efficient responses. This economic model is designed to foster a self-regulating network where quality of service is matched with appropriate compensation, ensuring scalability and sustainability.

The 1inch Network not only revolutionizes the way services are hosted and accessed in the web3 space but also lays the groundwork for an array of decentralized applications—ranging from file storage solutions to streaming services, and from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to blockchain query handling—thus heralding a new epoch of internet where decentralization is not just a promise, but an operational reality.

## 1. Introduction

As the web evolves into its third major iteration, an inherent contradiction has become apparent: the decentralized applications (dApps) and services that constitute the new web3 frontier are frequently dependent on centralized hosting solutions. This reliance poses a spectrum of risks, from heightened censorship to the prospect of entire services being discontinued by centralized entities. Recognizing the critical need for a truly decentralized infrastructure, the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network has been conceived.

The 1inch P2P Decentralized Network is a bold leap forward, a peer-to-peer fabric designed specifically to support the next wave of innovation in the web3 space. It is not merely a network but an ecosystem that enables a new class of applications to flourish, free from the constraints and vulnerabilities of centralization. By leveraging blockchain technology and a native payment structure, this network is engineered to deliver services that are resilient, autonomous, and inherently aligned with the principles of a decentralized internet.

In this P2P network, every participant is both a contributor and a beneficiary. Users, engaging through lightweight dApps, can interact with the network without sacrificing their privacy or exposing themselves to the whims of centralized service providers. Relayers serve as the connective tissue of the network, preserving privacy and enhancing efficiency, while resolvers carry the mantle of response and computation, embodying the decentralized spirit by providing services in exchange for micro-payments.

The challenges of the current web3 landscape—centralized storage, file hosting, and DNS services—are addressed head-on by this network. By structurally incentivizing participation through economic means, the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network not only disincentivizes malicious activity such as DoS attacks but also creates a fertile ground for innovation and development.

The cornerstone of the network's integrity is its governance model, which integrates community participation directly into the operational fabric of the system. Staking 1INCH tokens enables users to amass 'Unicorn Power,' granting them a say in the selection and endorsement of resolvers. This democratic approach ensures that the network remains true to its users' interests and resilient against takeover attempts.

The introduction of the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network marks the beginning of a paradigm shift. It signifies a move away from the centralized architectures that currently underpin web3 and a step towards a decentralized future where users and developers enjoy uninterrupted access to services, fortified by the security and distributed nature of blockchain technology. In the following sections, we will delve into the network's architecture, the roles and incentives of its participants, and the rich tapestry of applications it enables.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 The Centralization Dilemma in Web3

With the advent of blockchain technology and the subsequent proliferation of decentralized applications (dApps), there has been a paradigm shift towards what is commonly referred to as web3 — a user-centric internet where individuals have control over their data, identity, and transactions. This evolution promises to mitigate the shortcomings of the web2 era, characterized by data monopolies and centralized gatekeepers. However, the current state of web3 infrastructure is paradoxically reliant on centralized services such as cloud providers for hosting, storage, and domain name resolution. This reliance undermines the very ethos of decentralization, introducing points of failure and control that run counter to the ideals of the blockchain space.

### 2.2 Challenges and Limitations

Web3's dependence on centralized services not only creates vulnerabilities but also exposes dApps and their users to a myriad of risks, including censorship, service outages, and arbitrary discontinuation of services by providers. Additionally, the lack of decentralized domain name services (DNS) and hosting solutions constrains the potential of dApps and restricts the seamless user experience necessary for mass adoption. Moreover, backend services for dApps, which are crucial for complex operations and user interactions, remain predominantly centralized, creating bottlenecks and potential security concerns.

### 2.3 Emerging Needs

The growing awareness of these challenges has led to a consensus within the web3 community on the need for a robust, decentralized network that can provide the services and infrastructure necessary for the unencumbered operation of dApps. There is a clear demand for a system that not only supports file storage and dynamic content delivery but also ensures that all network interactions are secure, private, and resistant to censorship and attacks.

### 2.4 1inch's Vision for Decentralization

Against this backdrop, the 1inch Network has recognized an opportunity to contribute to the evolution of web3 infrastructure. Building on our expertise in developing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and leveraging the 1inch ecosystem's resources, we envision the creation of the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network. This network is designed to address the centralization concerns plaguing current web3 services by introducing a distributed layer of relayers and resolvers that function within a secure and incentivized payment protocol.

The network aims to provide a resilient and scalable foundation for various products and services, including but not limited to decentralized file storage, streaming services, wallet balance information, decentralized order books, and blockchain RPC call handling. The architectural design of the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network allows for seamless interactions between users, relayers, and resolvers, facilitated by an innovative payment channel and a transparent, community-driven governance model.

In the subsequent sections, we will explore the technical architecture of the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network, detailing the mechanisms through which it achieves decentralization, security, and functionality, thereby laying the groundwork for a truly decentralized web3 ecosystem.

## 3. The 1inch P2P Decentralized Network Overview

### 3.1 Conceptual Architecture

The 1inch P2P Decentralized Network is predicated upon a peer-to-peer (P2P) topology, designed to operate without reliance on centralized servers or managed infrastructure. At its core, the network facilitates seamless interactions among its primary actors: Users, Relayers, and Resolvers.

- **Users**: Participants who access the network via web3 applications (dApps). They initiate requests and provide micro-payments for services rendered.
- **Relayers**: Nodes that act as intermediaries, relaying requests and responses between users and resolvers. They are compensated for their role in data transmission and maintaining network privacy.
- **Resolvers**: Nodes responsible for processing user requests and delivering the required service or information. They are incentivized by payments corresponding to the complexity and resource consumption of the services provided.

Each actor plays a critical role in the ecosystem, ensuring the network's decentralization, efficiency, and privacy.

### 3.2 Network Interactions

Interactions within the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network are designed to be secure, efficient, and decentralized, leveraging an encrypted Remote Procedure Call (RPC) approach for communication among actors. Here's a detailed overview:

1. **User Request Initialization**:
   A User creates an RPC request to perform a specific action or retrieve data. This request includes meta information such as the service required, parameters (e.g., `1inch_getWalletBalance` with network and token parameters), and a payment offer, all signed by the user.

2. **Payment Signature and Encryption**:
   The user signs the request with a unique payment signature via an off-chain payment channel. This signature outlines the maximum amount the user is willing to pay (e.g., $0.0001 max). The entire RPC call is then encrypted with the public keys of potential Resolvers to ensure privacy and security.

3. **Relayer Transmission**:
   The encrypted request is sent to a Relayer. The Relayer’s role is to act as a proxy, transmitting the request to multiple Resolvers without decrypting its content. This process maintains user anonymity and ensures that Relayers cannot tamper with or view sensitive request data.

4. **Resolver Processing**:
   Resolvers, upon receiving an encrypted request, use their private keys to decrypt the message. If they decide to process the request — typically based on the attached payment offer and their capacity — they execute the required operation, encrypt the response, and send it back to the Relayer.

5. **Response and Payment Execution**:
   The Relayer forwards the encrypted response back to the User. Once the User decrypts and validates the response, the payment channel processes the payment to the Resolver, completing the transaction.

6. **Incentive Structure**:
   Relayers are incentivized to efficiently forward messages as they receive a fee from the successful transactions they facilitate. Similarly, Resolvers are incentivized to respond promptly and accurately to requests that meet their cost criteria, as their payment is contingent upon the delivery of the requested service.

The use of an encrypted RPC approach ensures that communication across the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network is secure, private, and tamper-evident. This system aligns with the network's overarching goals of decentralization and resistance to censorship, positioning the 1inch Network as a robust infrastructure for the next evolution of web3 services.

### 3.3 Ensuring Privacy and Security

The privacy and security of communications are paramount within the 1inch Network. Users sign their requests which include a payment offer, encrypt them with the public keys of potential **Resolvers**, and then send these requests through **Relayers** to ensure that only the intended Resolvers can read and respond to them.

### 3.4 Dynamic Network Participation

**Relayers** and **Resolvers** join the network by registering themselves via a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, which records their IP addresses and service capabilities. To maximize privacy, **Relayers** do not disclose information about the users or resolvers they connect, and they operate only as a transparent and neutral proxy within the network.

### 3.5 Governance and Incentive Mechanisms

The governance of the 1inch Network is community-focused, with the **1INCH token** holders possessing the ability to delegate their 'Unicorn Power' to endorse **Resolvers**. This stake-weighted system promotes a meritocratic structure where the top-performing and most reliable resolvers are white-listed and incentivized to maintain high service standards.

In subsequent sections, we delve deeper into the technical implementation of these concepts, the economic models that support the network, and the wide array of applications that can be realized on this innovative infrastructure.

## 4. Ensuring Privacy and Security

The 1inch P2P Decentralized Network is engineered with the highest standards of privacy and security at its core. The following components and strategies are key to maintaining this robust framework:

1. **End-to-End Encryption**:
   All RPC requests and responses are encrypted end-to-end using asymmetric cryptography. When a User initiates a request, it is encrypted with the public key of the potential Resolver. Only the selected Resolver, who holds the corresponding private key, can decrypt and process the request. This ensures that sensitive data is unreadable by any intermediaries, such as Relayers or malicious actors who might intercept the communication.

2. **Off-Chain Payment Channels**:
   Transactions for services are conducted through off-chain payment channels. These channels not only enable high transaction throughput but also ensure that payment details remain confidential and are only known between the User and the Resolver. This preserves financial privacy and reduces on-chain bloat, leading to lower fees and faster settlements.

3. **Anonymity Through Relayers**:
   Relayers serve as the anonymous couriers of the network. They are designed to forward requests without having the ability to decrypt them, preventing any form of data snooping. By not storing or logging information about the User or the Resolvers, Relayers support the network’s stance on anonymity and privacy.

4. **Resolver Anonymity and Security**:
   Resolvers, while being service providers within the network, operate without revealing their identities to the Users or other network participants. They only provide a public key for the Users to encrypt their requests. Resolvers process the requests securely and respond with the same level of encryption. This setup minimizes the risk of targeted attacks against specific Resolvers.

5. **Immutable and Transparent Registration of Relayers**:
   Relayers must register their service parameters, such as IP address and supported protocols, on an Ethereum smart contract when they come online. Although this information is public, it does not compromise their role in maintaining User privacy, as they do not relay any identifying information. Unregistering from the smart contract removes the Relayer from the pool, ensuring that the list of active Relayers is always up-to-date and resistant to sybil attacks.

6. **Decentralized Governance of Resolvers**:
   The selection of top Resolvers is governed by the 1inch community through a staking mechanism where 1INCH token holders, by acquiring Unicorn Power (UP), can delegate their voting power. This process ensures that only the most trusted and high-performing Resolvers are white-listed, promoting a secure and reliable network.

7. **Secure Node Discovery**:
   Rather than relying on a traditional DNS system, the 1inch Network utilizes a decentralized approach to node discovery, mitigating the risk of DNS spoofing and related attacks. The discovery mechanism operates within the boundaries of blockchain technology, ensuring trust and verifiability.

8. **Rate-Limiting and Anti-DDoS Measures**:
   To prevent denial-of-service attacks, each request within the network requires a micro-payment. This economic barrier dissuades malicious actors from flooding the network with requests, as it would become prohibitively expensive. Additionally, this model encourages efficiency and prioritization of service requests based on User payments.

By integrating these mechanisms, the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network is fortified against external threats and internal abuses, preserving the privacy and security of all participants and ensuring that the network remains resilient and robust in the face of evolving cybersecurity challenges.

## 5. Technical Architecture

The 1inch P2P Decentralized Network's technical architecture is designed to be resilient, scalable, and modular. It consists of several key components that work in concert to provide a decentralized service layer for Web3 applications.

### 5.1 Network Nodes
Network nodes in the 1inch P2P Network are categorized into three types:

1. **Users (Thin Clients)**:
    - Users interact with the network via dApps that act as thin clients.
    - These clients are lightweight, requiring minimal resources to operate.
    - They generate encrypted RPC requests and process responses from the network.

2. **Relayers**:
    - Relayers act as the network's routers, facilitating the transmission of messages.
    - They register on an Ethereum smart contract to advertise their availability.
    - Relayers are responsible for handling the encrypted traffic, maintaining privacy and data integrity without being privy to the content.

3. **Resolvers**:
    - Resolvers are service providers that execute the requests.
    - They decrypt incoming messages, process the requested actions, and encrypt the responses.
    - Top resolvers are selected via community governance, ensuring a trusted set of service providers.

## 5.2 Off-Chain Payment Channels

### 5.2.1 User-Directed Payment Cap with Dutch Auction Mechanics

The 1inch P2P Decentralized Network introduces a refined payment mechanism for handling transactions tied to RPC calls, employing a Dutch auction model with millisecond precision.

1. **Dutch Auction Timing**:
   - Each RPC request is embedded with a user-signed payment signature indicating the precise moment from which the auction commences, accompanied by a user-defined maximum price cap for the transaction.
   - Following the timestamp, the resolver's potential compensation begins to increase with each passing millisecond, adding urgency to the transaction processing.

2. **Rapid Execution Window**:
   - For example, an RPC call requesting an ETH wallet balance from the Ethereum network has an expected completion threshold of under one second.
   - Within this window, specifically the first 500 milliseconds, the resolver's remuneration rises progressively until it hits the user's maximum price threshold.

3. **Incremental Payment Increase**:
   - This design incentivizes resolvers to prioritize and quickly process requests, capitalizing on the rising remuneration leading up to the user's payment ceiling.

4. **Ensuring Cost Control and Timely Services**:
   - Users are protected from overpaying as the cost will not surpass the predetermined maximum limit.
   - Resolvers undertaking the RPC call are obligated to fulfill the request within the time frame, ensuring that users are not charged beyond their set limit.

### 5.2.2 Transaction Finalization and Payment Processing

The execution and settlement of payments transpire as follows:

1. **Auction Closure Upon RPC Call Commitment**:
   - The moment a resolver commits to an RPC call, the Dutch auction for that request is concluded.
   - The remuneration is then set, which will be at or below the maximum limit based on the lock-in timing.

2. **Confirmed Compensation and Assured Execution**:
   - The resolver is guaranteed the auction-determined remuneration upon the successful and timely execution of the RPC call.
   - This system ensures that users receive prompt service, while relayers and resolvers are incentivized for their swift and efficient marketplace responses.

By integrating this nuanced Dutch auction approach with off-chain payment channels, the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network ensures a user-focused, equitable, and transparent process for managing and prioritizing user requests, maintaining an equilibrium between user costs and the motivation for resolvers.

### 5.3 Encryption Mechanisms
Encryption is integral to the security of the 1inch Network:

1. **Asymmetric Cryptography**:
    - Public-private key pairs are used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
    - This ensures that only intended resolvers can access the data within a request.

2. **Secure Key Exchange**:
    - Key exchange protocols facilitate the safe distribution of public keys.
    - A decentralized public key infrastructure (PKI) prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 5.4 Smart Contract Layer
Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain handle various administrative functions:

1. **Registration of Relayers and Resolvers**:
    - Relayers must register their endpoint information for discovery.
    - Resolvers are registered along with their service offerings and public keys.

2. **Staking and Governance**:
    - The 1INCH token is used for staking and participating in governance decisions.
    - Staking mechanisms are in place for selecting and endorsing resolvers.

3. **Payment Settlement**:
    - Final settlement of payments occurs on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and finality.

### 5.5 Data Transport Protocols
Multiple data transport protocols are supported to maximize compatibility and performance:

1. **WebSockets**:
    - Enables real-time bi-directional communication between clients and relayers.

2. **WebTransport**:
    - Allows low-latency streams, optimized for quick data transfer.

3. **WebRTC**:
    - Provides peer-to-peer communication capabilities, essential for decentralized operations.

4. **Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC)**:
   - QUIC is a transport layer network protocol designed by Google. The main benefits of QUIC over TCP and TLS/SSL include reduced connection and transport latency, and multiplexed streams without head-of-line blocking.


### 5.6 Network Discovery and Message Propagation
The network leverages a decentralized yet robust discovery mechanism that is solely based on Ethereum smart contracts, negating the need for traditional DHTs or Gossip protocols.

1. **Ethereum Smart Contract Registry**:
    - Relayers register their presence on an Ethereum smart contract, indicating their availability to the network.
    - The registry includes endpoint information such as supported protocols, IP addresses, and port details.
    - This allows for a decentralized discovery process that is easily verifiable and trustless, leveraging the security and transparency of the Ethereum blockchain.

2. **Message Routing**:
    - Upon receiving an encrypted RPC request from a user, relayers forward the message to the appropriate resolver or set of resolvers based on the payment and service requirements.
    - Relayers do not decrypt or inspect the contents of the traffic, ensuring user privacy and data integrity.

3. **Dynamic Participation**:
    - Relayers can dynamically join or leave the network by registering or deregistering in the smart contract.
    - This allows for a fluid network topology that is resilient to changes and does not rely on any central point of failure.

The integration of Ethereum smart contracts into the discovery and registration process ensures that the network remains open, transparent, and resistant to censorship. By utilizing blockchain technology, the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network provides a trust-minimized environment that fosters participation and innovation.

### 5.7 High Availability and Load Balancing
The network architecture is designed for high availability:

1. **Redundancy**:
    - Multiple relayers and resolvers ensure that services remain available even if individual nodes fail.

2. **Load Balancing**:
    - Requests are distributed across the network to prevent overloading of individual nodes.

The technical architecture of the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network lays the foundation for a scalable and secure platform. It enables the creation of a wide range of decentralized services while preserving user privacy and data integrity. With its robust infrastructure, the network is poised to power the next generation of decentralized applications.

## 6. Community Governance and Resolver Selection

In the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network, community governance plays a pivotal role in the selection and endorsement of Resolvers, which are the network's service providers. The governance process is underpinned by the 1INCH token and is designed to be democratic, transparent, and effective in maintaining high-quality service across the network.

### 6.1 Staking and Unicorn Power (UP)

1. **1INCH Token Staking**:
    - Token holders can stake 1INCH tokens to participate in governance decisions. The staking mechanism is not only a financial commitment but also a means to gauge the community's sentiment.
    - Staked tokens generate Unicorn Power (UP), a non-transferable credit that represents the voting power of stakeholders in the network.

2. **Delegation of UP**:
    - Stakeholders can delegate their UP to Resolvers they trust and support. This process democratizes the selection of Resolvers, making it community-driven.
    - The delegation is flexible, allowing stakeholders to redistribute their UP as they see fit, according to the performance and reliability of the Resolvers.

### 6.2 Resolver Selection Process

1. **Top Resolvers**:
    - Resolvers compete for UP delegations from the community. Only the top 10 Resolvers with the most UP become active and are allowed to process requests.
    - This meritocratic system ensures that only the most reputable and reliable Resolvers are serving the user base.

2. **Dynamic Leaderboard**:
    - A public leaderboard displays the current rankings of Resolvers based on the UP they have attracted. The leaderboard is dynamic, reflecting real-time changes in stakeholder preferences.

3. **Election Cycles**:
    - Resolver elections happen in regular cycles. At the end of each cycle, the UP tally is counted, and the top Resolvers are selected for the next period.
    - This periodic reset ensures that new participants have the opportunity to become Resolvers, fostering competition and innovation.

### 6.3 Governance Proposals

1. **Proposal Submission**:
    - Any stakeholder with a minimum required amount of UP can submit proposals for consideration by the community.
    - Proposals can range from changes in network parameters to the introduction of new features or policies.

2. **Community Debate and Voting**:
    - Proposals are debated in the community forums, where stakeholders can discuss their merits and potential impacts on the network.
    - Voting is conducted in a transparent manner where each stakeholder's UP translates into votes. The outcome of votes directly influences the decision-making process.

### 6.4 Transparency and Accountability

1. **Public Auditing**:
    - All governance activities, including UP delegations, voting, and the Resolver election results, are recorded on the blockchain, making them publicly auditable.
    - The immutable nature of blockchain entries ensures that the process is tamper-proof and history cannot be rewritten.

2. **Resolver Accountability**:
    - Resolvers are accountable to the community that elected them. They must adhere to the network's service standards and are subject to removal if they underperform or act maliciously.
    - Regular performance reviews and the threat of losing UP delegations create strong incentives for Resolvers to maintain high standards of service.

The community governance model is at the heart of the 1inch P2P Decentralized Network's ethos. It aligns the interests of all network participants, from token holders to service providers, ensuring a harmonious and progressive ecosystem. The Resolver selection process, underpinned by transparent and democratic principles, facilitates a self-regulating environment where the best service providers thrive.
